## EnergiScope: Clustering Global Energy Systems for Sustainable Transitions

---

**Ultimate Goal:**  
Enable data-driven global decarbonization strategies by identifying country archetypes of electricity generation and supporting a **20% reduction in power-sector CO₂ intensity within 5 years**.

**Sub-Problems:**
- **Energy Source Dependence:** Determine which countries rely heavily on fossil fuels, renewables, or nuclear power.
- **Transition Readiness:** Identify nations positioned to shift quickly toward renewables versus those requiring longer transition pathways.
- **Infrastructure & Technology Mix:** Understand how capacity type and age impact flexibility.
- **Policy & Financing Gaps:** Reveal where policy mechanisms and investments are misaligned with system needs.

| **Sub-Problem** | **Who** | **What** | **Where** | **When** | **Why** |
|------------------|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Energy Source Dependence** | National energy ministries, power utilities, grid operators | Shares of coal, gas, oil, hydro, wind, solar, nuclear | Global dataset covering 150+ countries | Snapshot (latest year, 2023) | Identify dominant sources driving emissions and transition barriers |
| **Transition Readiness** | Policymakers, investors, sustainability organizations | Share of renewables vs. fossil, existing infrastructure capacity | Regional clusters (e.g., Europe, Asia, Africa) | Over next 5 years (transition outlook) | Target funding and tech support where readiness is highest |
| **Infrastructure & Technology Mix** | Power companies, regulators | Type, efficiency, age of generation capacity | Country-level facilities and resource availability | Annual review cycles | Assess technical feasibility of clean-energy integration |
| **Policy & Financing Gaps** | Governments, financial institutions, NGOs | Carbon pricing, subsidies, renewable investment ratios | International (by development level and cluster type) | Continuous, policy-evaluation intervals | Direct financing and incentives toward under-supported archetypes |

**2x2 Matrix of Potential Clustering Objectives**

| **Impact / Feasibility** | **High Feasibility** | **Low Feasibility** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **High Impact** | **→ Primary Focus:** Cluster countries by **current electricity generation mix** (coal, gas, renewables, nuclear) to identify decarbonization archetypes and inform targeted transition policies. | Cluster countries by **policy-readiness and financial capacity** (requires external datasets; long-term expansion). |
| **Low Impact** | Cluster **sub-regions within countries** (where data exists) to refine national archetypes; useful as pilot studies. | Cluster by **infrastructure age and efficiency** (data sparse globally; needs engineering-level inputs). |

**Priority:**  
Begin with **energy-mix clustering (high impact, high feasibility)** to produce actionable global archetypes that can directly inform SDG 7 & 13 reporting. Expand into **policy and infrastructure clustering** as richer datasets become available.

---

- **Starting Point:** Country-level clustering by electricity generation mix (coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, nuclear, biofuels).  
- **Short-Term Outcome:** Define 4–6 global archetypes to guide decarbonization strategies.  
- **Long-Term Vision:** Integrate policy-readiness and investment flows to support differentiated energy transitions.  
- **Impact Target:** Contribute to a **20% reduction in global power-sector CO₂ intensity** through better-informed, cluster-specific transition policies.
