### Capstone Project: *Global Energy Clustering for Sustainable Development*  

---

## 1. Overview  
This report summarizes the comprehensive **data quality assessment** performed on the *Global Electricity Production Dataset* used to analyze and cluster countries based on their energy generation structures.  
The objective of this review is to ensure that the dataset is **accurate, complete, consistent, and valid**, supporting credible sustainability insights aligned with **UN SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)**.

## 2. Dataset Description  

| Attribute Type | Columns | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Identifier** | `country_name` | National entity label |
| **Temporal** | `year`, `month` | Aggregated from monthly to annual values |
| **Measurement** | 16 energy products | Electricity generation by source (e.g., Coal, Hydro, Solar, Nuclear) |
| **Unit** | `GWh` | All quantities standardized to gigawatt-hours |

**Scope:**  
- **Coverage:** 48 countries  
- **Time Range:** 2000–2023 (latest year used for analysis: **2023**)  
- **Total Records:** 121,074 observations before aggregation

## 3. Data Quality Metrics  

| Dimension | Metric | Result | Interpretation |
|------------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Completeness** | Missing values | **0%** after aggregation | Dataset is fully complete. |
| **Uniqueness** | Duplicate records | **0** | Each `(country, product, year)` record is unique. |
| **Consistency** | Unit and schema standardization | 100% consistent | All measurements expressed in `GWh`. |
| **Accuracy (Logical)** | Negative or invalid values | None found | All values ≥ 0; no physical inconsistencies. |
| **Validity** | Temporal consistency | Valid across 2000–2023 | Aggregation ensures coherent annual summaries. |
| **Outlier Frequency** | IQR / Z-score / Isolation Forest | 5 countries (~10%) | Valid extreme cases (structural, not erroneous). |

---

## 4. Validation Process  

### 4.1 Internal Checks  
- Verified data types (`float64` for metrics, `object` for categories).  
- Cross-checked renewable totals (`Total Renewables ≈ Hydro + Solar + Wind + Geo + Other`).  
- Confirmed consistent aggregation across all products and countries.  
- Ensured no null or duplicated entries remain.  

### 4.2 Domain & Expert Validation  
Cross-referenced variable definitions and energy categories with authoritative sources:  
- **International Energy Agency (IEA) Energy Balances 2023**  
- **UN SDG 7 indicator framework**  
- **IPCC AR6 sectoral data guidelines**  

**Validation Outcomes:**  
- Retained feature groups represent major global electricity sources (fossil, nuclear, renewable).  
- Outlier nations (China, U.S., Japan, Korea, Mexico) verified as structurally distinct — not data errors.  
- Dataset accurately captures the range of national energy profiles.

## 5. Identified Limitations  

| Limitation | Description | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Temporal aggregation** | Monthly data averaged into yearly totals | Potential loss of short-term variation | Use annual data for structural comparison; future work may include time-series clustering |
| **Geographical scope** | 48 countries (partial global coverage) | May underrepresent smaller developing economies | Extend dataset to additional regions |
| **Aggregate features** | Total renewable/fossil indicators introduce collinearity | Affects PCA and clustering performance | Removed via correlation filtering |
| **Measurement uncertainty** | “Data is estimated for this month” feature | Low analytical value; may indicate modeled data | Removed during feature selection |
| **Energy conversion assumptions** | Electricity-only focus (not full energy system) | Narrow scope for carbon footprint assessment | Supplement with emissions or consumption data in next phase |

## 6. Quality Improvements Implemented  

| Action | Technique | Result |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Missing value handling** | Verified and confirmed none | Ensured full completeness |
| **Low-variance feature removal** | VarianceThreshold (<0.01) | Dropped redundant “Data is estimated…” column |
| **Correlation filtering** | Removed |r| > 0.9 pairs | Eliminated overlapping energy aggregates |
| **Unit normalization** | Converted all units to GWh | Ensured comparability across sources |
| **Outlier validation** | IQR, Z-score, Isolation Forest, domain review | Retained genuine outliers for representativeness |
| **Scaling** | StandardScaler (0 mean, unit variance) | Equalized feature influence during clustering |

## 7. Quality Index Summary  

| Quality Dimension | Weight | Score (0–1) | Notes |
|--------------------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Completeness | 0.25 | **1.00** | Fully populated dataset |
| Consistency | 0.25 | **1.00** | Uniform schema and units |
| Accuracy | 0.20 | **0.95** | Small portion of estimated data |
| Validity | 0.15 | **0.90** | Slight geographic bias |
| Timeliness | 0.15 | **0.85** | Data up to 2023 |
| **Overall Quality Index** | — | **0.94 (High)** | Excellent analytical readiness |

## 8. Implications for Clustering  

- The **absence of missing or inconsistent data** ensures reliable pattern discovery.  
- **Outliers retained intentionally** → valuable for identifying unique energy archetypes.  
- **Feature scaling and de-correlation** improved clustering separation (Silhouette: **0.652 → 0.685**).  
- The resulting dataset supports **transparent, reproducible sustainability analytics**.  

---

## 9. Continuous Improvement Strategies  

1. **Expand Coverage:** Integrate additional developing and island nations.  
2. **Temporal Deepening:** Analyze multiple years to track energy transition dynamics.  
3. **Cross-validation:** Compare with World Bank and IRENA energy datasets.  
4. **Metadata Enhancement:** Record source reliability and estimation flags.  
5. **Uncertainty Quantification:** Add confidence intervals for modeled values.

## 10. Conclusion  

The dataset demonstrates **high structural integrity, completeness, and consistency** suitable for advanced clustering and sustainability interpretation.  
All detected outliers represent authentic, domain-relevant energy system structures.  
Remaining limitations—geographical scope and temporal aggregation—are transparent and manageable.  

This quality review builds **stakeholder confidence** and ensures that clustering insights are **data-driven, trustworthy, and aligned with global sustainability objectives**.
