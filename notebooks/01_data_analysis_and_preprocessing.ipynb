    "| **Total Combustible Fuels** | Combined generation from all fossil and bio-based fuels: coal, oil, natural gas, and biofuels. Represents thermal generation. |\n",
    "| **Coal, Peat and Manufactured Gases** | Generation from coal-based fuels (hard coal, lignite, peat) and derived gases like coke oven gas or blast furnace gas. High CO₂ intensity. |\n",
    "| **Oil and Petroleum Products** | Electricity produced from crude oil and refined petroleum fuels (diesel, heavy fuel oil, etc.). Often used for backup generation. |\n",
    "| **Natural Gas** | Power generated from natural gas combustion. Lower CO₂ intensity than coal or oil, often used in combined-cycle plants. |\n",

    "| **Tide, Wave and Ocean** | Experimental or small-scale generation from oceanic sources: tidal streams, waves, ocean currents, and thermal gradients. Renewable and location-specific. |\n",
    "| **Nuclear** | Electricity generated through controlled nuclear fission reactions. Low CO₂ but includes waste and safety concerns. |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "The raw dataset includes **monthly electricity generation values** for each **country and energy source**.  \n",
    "To analyze national energy systems and perform clustering, we needed to represent **each country with a single, stable profile** rather than fluctuating monthly data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale for Annual Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remove Seasonal Noise**\n",
    "   - Monthly values capture short-term variability (e.g., hydro peaks, solar dips).\n",
    "   - Annual totals smooth out seasonal fluctuations, highlighting *structural differences* between energy systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensure Cross-Country Comparability**\n",
    "   - Countries operate in different hemispheres and climates, so comparing January vs. July is misleading.\n",
    "   - Aggregating to yearly totals ensures all countries are evaluated over the *same full production cycle*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reflect Policy-Relevant Metrics**\n",
    "   - Energy transition decisions are based on *annual generation shares* (e.g., % renewable electricity per year), not monthly patterns.\n",
    "   - Policymakers use yearly data for SDG 7 and SDG 13 reporting and investment planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simplify Clustering Features**\n",
    "   - Aggregation condenses 12×N observations into one record per country, enabling clustering on stable features (coal%, solar%, hydro%, etc.).\n",
    "   - Reduces noise and avoids overfitting to short-term dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Support Sustainability Insights**\n",
    "   - Year-level aggregation highlights structural energy mix archetypes:\n",
    "     - *Fossil-dominant systems*\n",
    "     - *Renewable-transitioning systems*\n",
    "     - *Hydro/nuclear-dependent systems*\n",
    "   - These clusters are meaningful for long-term policy and investment, not month-to-month operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "After aggregation:\n",
    "- Each country is represented by **its total and average electricity production per energy source** for the **latest year**.\n",
    "- The data now accurately reflects **annual energy mix composition**, ready for **clustering and sustainability analysis**."
